   Answer:
   - Debugging in vs code:
 . Create launch.json: Define a launch configuration for your program in the .vscode folder.
 . Define a launch configuration: Specify the type, request, name, and program to debug in launch.json.
 . Start the debugger: Open the Debug View, select the launch configuration, and click the "Play" button or press F5.
 . Set breakpoints: Click in the gutter next to the line of code where you want to pause execution.
 . Start debugging: The debugger will pause at the first breakpoint, allowing you to step through code, inspect variables, and fix issues.
   - Debugging features in visual code:
 1. Breakpoints: You can set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter next to the line number. When the breakpoint is hit, the debugger will pause execution, and you can inspect variables, step through code, and more.

 2. Step Through Code: You can step through your code line by line, examining the state of variables and expressions at each step. You can use the "Step Over" (F10), "Step Into" (F11), and "Step Out" (Shift+F11) commands to navigate through your code.

 3. Variable Inspection: When the debugger is paused, you can inspect the values of variables and expressions in the "Variables" panel. You can also use the "Debug Console" to evaluate expressions and inspect variables.

10. Using Source Control:
 - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

 Answer:
  - To integrate Git with VS Code for version control, you can start by running git config --global core.editor "code --wait" to set VS Code as the default editor for Git. Then, you can use VS Code as the diff and merge tool by adding configurations to your Git settings. This allows you to use VS Code's diff and merge capabilities even when using Git from the command line. Additionally, you can use VS Code for interactive rebase, commit messages, and interactive add, and also work with GitHub pull requests and issues directly from VS Code.

 The process:

   Initialize a Git Repository:
 - Open the folder in VS Code
 - Open the Source Control view
 - Click the Initialize Repository button

 Make Commits:
 - Make changes to files
 - Open the Source Control view
 - Stage changes
 - Enter a commit message
 - Click the Commit button

 Push Changes to GitHub:
 - Create a new repository on GitHub
 - Open the Source Control view
 - Click the ... icon and select Push
 - Enter GitHub repository URL and credentials if prompted
 - Visual Code will push changes to GitHub
